# search_mode = "fuzzy"

## which filter mode to use
## possible values: global, host, session, directory
filter_mode = "host"

## which search mode to use when atuin is invoked from a shell up-key binding

## default history list format - can also be specified with the --format arg

## prevent commands matching any of these regexes from being written to history.
## Note that these regular expressions are unanchored, i.e. if they don't start
## with ^ or end with $, they'll match anywhere in the command.
## For details on the supported regular expression syntax, see
## https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax
# history_filter = [
#   "^secret-cmd",
#   "^innocuous-cmd .*--secret=.+",
# ]

## prevent commands run with cwd matching any of these regexes from being written
## to history. Note that these regular expressions are unanchored, i.e. if they don't
## start with ^ or end with $, they'll match anywhere in CWD.
## For details on the supported regular expression syntax, see
## https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax
# cwd_filter = [
#   "^/very/secret/area",

## Configure the maximum height of the preview to show.
## Useful when you have long scripts in your history that you want to distinguish
## by more than the first few lines.
# max_preview_height = 4

## Configure whether or not to show the help row, which includes the current Atuin
## version (and whether an update is available), a keymap hint, and the total
## amount of commands in your history.
show_help = true

## Configure whether or not to show tabs for search and inspect
# show_tabs = true

## Defaults to true. This matches history against a set of default regex, and will not save it if we get a match. Defaults include
## 1. AWS key id
## 2. Github pat (old and new)
## 3. Slack oauth tokens (bot, user)
## 4. Slack webhooks
## 5. Stripe live/test keys
# secrets_filter = true

## Defaults to true. If enabled, upon hitting enter Atuin will immediately execute the command. Press tab to return to the shell and edit.
# This applies for new installs. Old installs will keep the old behaviour unless configured otherwise.
